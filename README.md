## Development Notes

 - In addition to the required library specs, This project utilizes the
   [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) React Bootstrap library,
   along with bootstrap utility classes.
  
 - Supported (tested) Browsers: Commonly used modern browsers including Edge, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
 
 - Unsupported Browsers: Internet Explorer. To support this browser, polyfills/alternatives would need to be implimented for modern solutions including JS method 'includes()', css grid properties, and css object-fit. To honor the time frame of 8 hours, I've chosen to forgo support of this browser as it's not commonly used or supported by modern standards.
